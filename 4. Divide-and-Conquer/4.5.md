Use the master method to give tight asymptotic bounds for the following recurrences.

**a.** T(n) = 2T(n/4) + 1.

**b.** T(n) = 2T(n/4) + sqrt(n).

**c.** T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n.

**d.** T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n<sup>2</sup>.

### `Answer`
a = 2, b = 4, n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> = n<sup>log<sub>4</sub>2</sup> = sqrt(n)

**a.** f(n) = 1

Since f(n) = O(n<sup>log<sub>4</sub>2-ϵ</sup>), where ϵ = 2, T(n) = Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)

**b.** f(n) = sqrt(n)

Since f(n) = Θ(n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>) = Θ(sqrt(n)), T(n) = Θ(sqrt(n) lg n)

**c.** f(n) = n

Since f(n) = Ω(n<sup>log<sub>4</sub>2+ϵ</sup>), where ϵ = 0.5,

af(n/b) = 2(n/3) ≤ (2/3)n = cf(n) for c = 2/3, T(n) = Θ(n)

**d.** f(n) = n<sup>2</sup>

Since f(n) = Ω(n<sup>log<sub>4</sub>2+ϵ</sup>), where ϵ = 1.5,

af(n/b) = 2(n/3)<sup>2</sup> ≤ (2/9)n<sup>2</sup> = cf(n) for c = 2/9, T(n) = Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)

Professor Caesar wishes to develop a matrix-multiplication algorithm that is asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm. His algorithm will use the divide-and-conquer method, dividing each matrix into pieces of size n/4 × n/4, and the divide and combine steps together will take Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) time. He needs to determine how many subproblems his algorithm has to create in order to beat Strassen's algorithm. If his algorithm creates a subproblems, then the recurrence for the running time T(n) becomes T(n) = aT(n/4) + Θ(n<sup>2</sup>). What is the largest integer value of a for which Professor Caesar's algorithm would be asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm?

### `Answer`
Asymptotic running time for Strassen's algorithm is S(n) = Θ(n<sup>lg 7</sup>)

Reccurence for the running time for Professor Caesar's algorithm is T(n) = aT(n/4) + Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)

For Professor Caesar's algorithm to be asymptotically faster than Strassen's algorithm,

n<sup>log<sub>4</sub>a</sup> < n<sup>lg 7</sup>, b = 4

= n<sup>lg a/lg 4</sup> < n<sup>lg 7</sup>

= n<sup>(lg a)/2</sup> < n<sup>lg 7</sup>

= (lg a)/2 < lg 7

= lg a < 2 lg 7

= lg a < lg 7<sup>2</sup>

= lg a < lg 49

= a < 49

Therefore, the largest integer value of a is 48.

Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1) is T(n) = Θ(lg⁡ n). (See Exercise 2.3-5 for a description of binary search.)

### `Answer`
a = 1, b = 2, n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> = n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>1</sup> = 1

Since f(n) = Θ(1), T(n) = Θ(lg n)
