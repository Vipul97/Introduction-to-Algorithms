### 16.2-2
***
Give a dynamic-programming solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem that runs in O(n W) time, where n is the number of items and W is the maximumm weight of items that the thief can put in his knapsack.

### `Answer`
```
Knapsack(n, W, val, wt)
    let K[n+1, W+1] be a new table
    for i = 0 to n
        K[i, 0] = 0
    for w = 0 to W
        K[0, w] = 0
    for i = 1 to n
        for w = 0 to W
            if wt[i - 1] <= w
                if val[i - 1] + K[i - 1, w - wt[i - 1]] > val[i - 1, w]
                    K[i, w] = val[i - 1] + K[i - 1, w - wt[i - 1]]
                else
                    K[i, w] = val[i - 1, w]
            else
                K[i, w] = val[i - 1, w]
    return K[n][W]
