### 22.1-1
***
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees?

### `Answer`
O(V + E) and O(V + E)

### 22.1-3
Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as input require time Ω(V<sup>2</sup>), but there are some exceptions. Show how to determine whether a directed graph G contains a universal sink — a vertex with in-degree |V| - 1 and out-degree 0 — in time O(V), given an adjacency matrix for G.

### `Answer`
```
IS-SINK(A, k)
  let A be |V| × |V|
  for j = 1 to |V|
      if A[k, j] = 1
          return FALSE
  for i = 1 to |V|
      if A[i, k] = 0 and i = k
          return FALSE
  return TRUE

UNIVERSAL-SINK(A)
  let A be |V| × |V|
  i = j = 1
  while i ≤ |V| and j ≤ |V|
      if A[i, j] = 1
          i = i + 1
  else j = j + 1
  s = 0
  if i > |V|
      return "there is no universal sink"
  elseif IS-SINK(A, i) = FALSE
      return "there is no universal sink"
  else return i "is a universal sink"
```
