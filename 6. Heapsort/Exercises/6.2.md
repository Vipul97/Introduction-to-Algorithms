Starting with the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY, write pseudocode for the procedure MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i), which performs the corresponding manipulation on a min-heap. How does the running time of MIN-HEAPIFY compare to that of MAX-HEAPIFY?

### `Answer`
```
MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i):
  l = LEFT(i)
  r = RIGHT(i)
	if l ≤ A.heap-size and A[l] < A[i]
	  smallest = l
	else smallest = i
	if r ≤ A.heap-size and A[r] < A[smallest]
	  smallest = r
	if smallest ≠ i:
	  exchange A[i] with A[smallest]
		MIN-HEAPIFY(A, smallest)
```
The running time is the same
