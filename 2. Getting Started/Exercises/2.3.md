Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.

### `Answer`
```
void Merge(int A[], int p, int q, int r)
{
    int i = p, j = q+1, k = p;
    int temp[10];

    while (i <= q && j <= r)
        if (A[i] <= A[j])
            temp[k++] = A[i++];
        else
            temp[k++] = A[j++];

    while (i <= q)
        temp[k++] = A[i++];

    while (j <= r)
        temp[k++] = A[j++];

    for (i = p; i <= r; i++)
        A[i] = temp[i];
}
```

### 2.3-5

Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against v and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. Binary search is an algorithm that repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is Î˜(lg n).

### `Answer`
```
void BinSearch(int A[], int high, int v)
{
    int low = 0, f = 0;

    while (low <= high)
    {
        int mid = (low+high)/2;

        if (A[mid] == v)
        {
            f = 1;
            break;
        }

        if (A[mid] < v)
            low = mid+1;
        else
            high = mid-1;
    }

    if (f == 1)
        printf("Found.\n");
    else
        printf("Not Found.\n");
}
```
