Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

### `Answer`
```
INSERTION-SORT(A)
    for j = 2 to A.length
        key = A[j]
        // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1].
        i = j - 1
        while i > 0 and A[i] < key
            A[i + 1] = A[i]
            i = i - 1
        A[i + 1] = key
```
