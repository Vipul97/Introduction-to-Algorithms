Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.

### `Answer`
```
void Merge(int A[], int p, int q, int r)
{
    int i = p, j = q+1, k = p;
    int temp[10];

    while (i <= q && j <= r)
        if (A[i] <= A[j])
            temp[k++] = A[i++];
        else
            temp[k++] = A[j++];

    while (i <= q)
        temp[k++] = A[i++];

    while (j <= r)
        temp[k++] = A[j++];

    for (i = p; i <= r; i++)
        A[i] = temp[i];
}
```

### 2.3-5

Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against v and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The **binary search** algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is Θ(lgn).

### `Answer`
```
BINARY-SEARCH(A, v):
    low = 1
    high = A.length
    while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if A[mid] == v
            return mid
        if A[mid] < v
            low = mid + 1
        else
            high = mid - 1
  return NIL
```

### 2.3-6
***
Observe that the **while** loop of lines 5 - 7 of the INSERTION-SORT procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray A[1..j - 1]. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to Θ(n lg n)?

### `Answer`
No
